# MacroSwitch
MacroSwitch for xkeybindings.

A simplified GUI for xbindkeys!

## Version 2.0 now out!
### Whats new:
- Prettier GUI
- Ability to add profiles!

### To-do list:
Making an editing tool instead of using gedit.
Make it auto-start xkindkeys ( Easy stuff )

### Current Profiles:
None.
I'll make some later

## How to install:
First open the script and modify the 'home' string to match your home directory ( This is extremely important and the program will not work without it.
Then do python macroswitchprofiles2.py and you're done.

Reminder : You need to startup xbindkeys first :p
